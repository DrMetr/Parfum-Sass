## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Dart Sass

### What I learned

I solved this challenge using pure css first (the oldstyle.css file) and then on its base I made a separate .scss file just to get used to the syntaxis. I learned how to implement Sass into VS Code, how to make mixins, how to import properties from another file and some other basic Sass stuff. I didn't encounter any new problems this time. 

### Continued development

I believe, this project is too small and easy for Sass to be applied for a reason other than training. I will continue applying it in further projects and try to use more of Sass diverse functions regardless of how justified it'd be.
